Each of these new relationships exposes the onboarding entity (e.g. government, bank, multinational corporation, etc) to risk (e.g. financial risk, reputational risk, FCPA/Bribery Act risk, sanctions breaches, etc.), and so they need to understand about the entity being onboarded."

In high value / high risk transactions, third parties are often employed to support due diligence processes. Onboarding entities are looking for red flags (e.g. whether the company is connected with Politically Exposed Persons or has earned negative media), and for confidence that there are no red flags they are missing (e.g. that a Beneficial Owner is connected with a company on a sanctions list). Following an assessment of risks, an informed judgement call typically determines whether new partnerships or transactions meet the policy requirements of the business."
