msgid "The ``annotations`` property of each statement MAY be used to provide additional contextual information at the level of a whole statement, a sub-object, or an individual property. For example an annotation might be used to include structured information detailing the nature of the interest held by a natural person in a company. In some cases, systems processing BODS data may make changes to clean, enhance or otherwise update the data, such as reconciling company names against identifiers. In this case, details of these changes SHOULD be recorded as annotations, to allow users to clearly understand the provenance of information."
